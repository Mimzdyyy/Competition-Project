We were able to build three models with a set accuracy of 0.97, while significantly reducing the number of feautures (just 7). This lead us to save running time 
(from 5.47 seconds to only 0.36)

With the reduced features, we were also able to describe how a company might go bankrupt or not, explaining the model better. The features conclusiones were:
Companies with:

high "Interest-bearing debt interest rate" tend to go bankrupt (≈ 0.000499)
high "Total debt/Total net worth" tend to go bankrupt (≈ 0.015723)
high "Fixed Assets Turnover Frequency" tend to go bankrupt (≈ 0.001225)
low "Cash/Total Assets" tend to go bankrupt (≈ 0.023755)
low "Equity to Liability" tend to go bankrupt (≈ 0.018662)
companies with a low 'Net profit before tax/Paid-in capital', 'Persistent EPS in the Last Four Seasons' and 'Net Value Per Share (A)' tend to go bankrupt
